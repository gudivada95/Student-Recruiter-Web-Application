    <h2>Welcome Future Pirates!</h2>
    <p>
      To begin with, we would like to thank you for considering East Carolina University. We want your campus visit to be informative
      and fun. Pirate Nation is excited to welcome you to our campus. During your campus visit, we want you to have all the
      information you need to make an informed decision about attending college here at East Carolina University. We have
      planned a full day of activities for you from a campus tour, to lunch, to possibly attending a student financial aid
      session if you like. Don't worry, you will have the opportunity to customize your campus visit by choosing which sessions
      you wish to attend. The agenda for your campus visit is outlined below. As you will note, we will begin with registraton
      outside of the Science and Technology Building. Next is an orientation session and two additional informational sessions
      from various departments. We have also included a free lunch in our main dining hall as well as the option for a student
      financial aid Q and A session. Finally, if you are an athlete, you can choose one or two athletic departments to visit
      for a chance to meet and talk with our award winning athletic staff, coaches, and student athletes. Finally, we hope
      you will end your campus visit with a tour of our beautiful campus!
